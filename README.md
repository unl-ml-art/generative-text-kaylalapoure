# Project 1 Generative Text

## Abstract
Do you ever wake up in the morning not knowing what to wear? I personally do. With the latest trends coming and going faster that we can buy them, wouldn’t it be nice for something to show you what exactly is timeless? Well, perhaps the fashion advice from this GPT2 could help. It was trained on a variety of fashion blogs and with an array of advice. Through adjusting a variety of elements on the model it outputs what is thought were the most important elements.

To showcase this fashion advice I created an array of drawings and fashion. I tried to make sure that each individual in the drawing has different, beautiful features to show that the fashion the AI gives transcends us as humans, but also for people to see themselves in this type of art and experience.


## Model/Data

For my model data I collated different fashion blogs. Many of them came with pictures that I didn’t include, which caused some nonsensical outputs. Overall, I tried to make sure the fashion advice was numbered so you could have ten elements that will elevate your fashion.

## Results

I curated the top ten pieces of fashion advice that I thought were the most interesting. The reason I selected only ten was to create a bite size experience to share with others. When thinking about fashion, people really only want to know the top tips, not necessarily a whole book of fashion advice. 

The fashion advice I took was trained in a variety of ways. I experimented a lot with the step to learning rate ratio. The most cohesive output came from a lower step, but a higher learning rate, I used around 500 steps and 1e-3 learning rate. While this was more understandable, some of the more playful advice came from training where this ratio was swapped. I trained it at 1000 steps and 1e-2 learning rate. 

Questions that help prompt the GPT with answers:
“For the perfect outfit try”
“Try”
“To be fashionable you must”

1.To avoid embarrassment and embarrassment, the outfit should be simple and casual. The idea of dressing with ease and with care is essential. Opt for the best fit and the most comfortable shoes for the person.

## Technical Notes


I used the cloned git file shared with me and the Jupyter lab. I then used my Project1V1 txt file to train the GPT2. Some elements I changed to get the results were the temperature (I generally used .7), the step, which was changed between 200-1000, and the learning rate, which was changed from 1e-2 to 1e-3.
