## Abstract
Do you ever wake up in the morning not knowing what to wear? I personally do. With the latest trends coming and going faster that we can buy them, wouldn’t it be nice for something to show you what exactly is timeless? Perhaps an RNN can. I plan to feed the RNN different fashion blogs and transcribed advice; let it sift through what is important and what isn’t. With the output of fashion that transcends time and ai, I can pull together outfits and become the most fashionable human in existence. Considering that I predominantly only t-shirts, I would like to draw or photoshop together a collage of the fashion advice the RNN shares with us. Overall, I think this is a playful way to explore RNNs and have a vibrant experience to share with the world.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
  - [This is a paper](this_is_the_link.pdf)
